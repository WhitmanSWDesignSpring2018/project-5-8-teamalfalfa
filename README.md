README: Project 8
=================================

* Give a concise overview of your design. How did you implement the new features? How does your design for Project 8 differ from your design for Project 7? How did you respond to feedback? (If I get it to you in time.)
* Explain why your way was the elegant way to do it. Address any improvements you made. For full credit, apply concepts, guidelines, and/or principles you learned in class.
* Explain what, if anything, in your solution is inelegant and why you didn't make it elegant (for example, maybe you didn't have time or the knowledge to fix it). For full credit, apply concepts, guidelines, and/or principles you learned in class.
* Include an estimate of your velocity. How many story points did you estimate you would complete during this project? How many did you actually complete, how many person-hours did the team spend, and what is the ratio of points/person-hour? How does this compare to your velocity for the previous project assignment?
* Include a short summary of your team retrospective. What went well that your team will keep doing during the next project assignment? What will you improve? How?
