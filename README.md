README: Project 8
=================================

* Give a concise overview of your design. How did you implement the new features? How does your design for Project 8 differ from your design for Project 7? How did you respond to feedback? (If I get it to you in time.)

In Project 8 we added custom improvements to the GUI and functionality and fixed several issues with the previous release of our code. Our code now allows the user to switch the instrument of any set of playables and adjust the volume using a slider, which changes the opacity of the notes. We improved the GUI by adding the option of a "dark mode," making prettier gestures and have a custom icon for the application.

As part of this project, we also fixed open issues. The composition pane now updates after notes are added or moved so that it can extend as far as needed. There was also a bug relating to "save" that we fixed, and an issue with selection when the user copied and pasted parts of the composition. 

* Explain why your way was the elegant way to do it. Address any improvements you made. For full credit, apply concepts, guidelines, and/or principles you learned in class.

Several elements of our new design are elegant. 

The dark mode takes advantage of high-level coding and existing libraries. Instead of changing the individual nodes in the pane, as we originally anticipated, we simply added a style sheet to the scene that adjusted all of the children nodes to a darker theme. Using a CheckMenuItem to select this option is intuitive and usable because the view mode toggles between exactly two options. 

* Explain what, if anything, in your solution is inelegant and why you didn't make it elegant (for example, maybe you didn't have time or the knowledge to fix it). For full credit, apply concepts, guidelines, and/or principles you learned in class.


* Include an estimate of your velocity. How many story points did you estimate you would complete during this project? How many did you actually complete, how many person-hours did the team spend, and what is the ratio of points/person-hour? How does this compare to your velocity for the previous project assignment?


* Include a short summary of your team retrospective. What went well that your team will keep doing during the next project assignment? What will you improve? How?

I wish that we could work together sometime in the future, but unfortunately this is the last project. During our retrospecitve we talked about what we enjoyed. Both Ian and Paul give thumbs up, and Paul even said that the process was "great."
