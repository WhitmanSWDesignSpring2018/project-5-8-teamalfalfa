# Tune Composer - Team Alfalfa

### Changing Instruments

This feature was implemented in order to allow user to change the instrument associated with Notes after the Notes have been added to the composition pane. We felt that this would be a nice addition as the alternative was to delete the Note and replace it with a new Note of the desired instrument. 

To use this feature, (1) firstly select the Notes to have their intrument changed. This can be a single Note or any number of selected Notes, including those within gestures. Next (2), the user must select the desired instrument from the lefthand side-bar. Finally (3), the user must either click the Edit menu, and select Change Instrument, or use the handy key combination of Ctrl + K.

### Changing Note Volume

This feature allows the user to maintain a greater level of control over their compositions by changing the volume at which respective Notes are played. By default, Notes are constructed with the maximum volume, but with this feature the user can specify the volume of individual or groups of selected Notes. Additionally, the volume of a Note is indicated by its opacity, ranging from 20% up to 100% by default.

To use this feature, the user must first (1) select the Notes they wish to change the volume for. The user must consider during this step that all of the Notes selected will be set to the same resulting volume due to the nature of our volume slider. Next (2), the user can click on the slider and begin to manipulate the volume of the selected Notes, observing the opacity change as the volume changes.

### Infinite Scroll

This feature was implemented in order to allow for compositions to extend past the default length of the composition pane. There is no user input required for this feature, as instead the pane will automatically extend when the user places Notes near the right edge of the pane.

### Note Labels

This feature requires no user input, and "simply" displays the Note values associated with the horizontal lines in the composition pane. This can benefit the user should they care to identify what each pitch equates to on a musical scale.

### Custom Icon

This was intended to replace the default empty icon displayed when one runs the Tune Composer, and once again requires no user input. We cooked our replacement icon in an effort to make sure our faces were associated each and every time our Tune Composer was used.

### Dark Mode (oooh ahh)

This feature was implemented to alleviate the weary eyes of our users. Also no application is a real application until Dark mode is implemented.

To use this feature, the user must first (1) click on the File menu, and then (2) click the Toggle Dark Mode item. To revert to Light Mode, the same steps maybe followed, and the check by the Toggle Dark Mode item will disappear.
