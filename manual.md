Changing Instruments

This feature was implemented in order to allow user to change the instrument associated with Notes after the Notes have been added to the composition pane. We felt that this would be a nice addition as the alternative was to delete the Note and replace it with a new Note of the desired instrument. 

To use this feature, (1) firstly select the Notes to have their intrument changed. This can be a single Note or any number of selected Notes, including those within gestures. Next (2), the user must select the desired instrument from the lefthand side-bar. Finally (3), the user must either click the Edit menu, and select Change Instrument, or use the handy key combination of Ctrl + K.
